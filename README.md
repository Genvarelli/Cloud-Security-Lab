# üö® Threat Detection & Monitoring Lab 
![Status](https://img.shields.io/badge/status-In%20Development-yellow)

## Project Overview
This project is a multi-VM cyber security lab designed to simulate enterprise infrastructure and explore threat detection, monitoring, and incident response in a controlled environment.

The lab includes Windows and Linux systems running Active Directory, Wazuh, Security Onion, and MailHog. Realistic attack scenarios are simulated using offensive tools such as Hydra, Evil-WinRM, NetExec, and XFreeRDP to test detection capabilities. Custom SIEM rules and alerts are developed to identify brute-force attempts, privilege escalation, and lateral movement. Logs are analysed, and incidents documented to improve blue team techniques and defensive visibility.
