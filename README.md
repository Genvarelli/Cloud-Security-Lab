# üö® Threat Detection & Monitoring Lab

## Project Overview
This project involves building a security monitoring lab to explore threat detection and incident response in a controlled environment. It covers the setup of monitoring systems, log analysis, network visibility, and threat hunting techniques, with a focus on simulating real-world scenarios and improving defensive capabilities.


## Skills Learned
- Gained hands-on experience in security monitoring within a lab environment
- Configured and deployed network traffic analysis tools
- Created alerts and rules for detecting suspicious activity
- Investigated simulated security incidents and developed response procedures
- Explored log collection, parsing, and analysis for threat detection and insights


## üñ•Ô∏è Operating Systems
- **Windows Server 2025**  
  Enterprise-grade OS for directory services and identity management. Serves as the central domain controller for network authentication and connectivity.

- **Windows 11 Enterprise**  
  Business-focused desktop OS optimized for productivity. Used to simulate a typical corporate end-user environment.
- **Ubuntu Desktop 22.04**  
  Versatile Linux desktop, ideal for development workflows. Simulates a software development workstation in an enterprise setting.
- **Security Onion**  
  Open-source platform for threat detection, log analysis, and intrusion detection. Used for monitoring and responding to network security events.
- **Ubuntu Server 22.04**  
  Reliable server OS for hosting services like mail, databases, and web applications. Deployed as the internal email server.
- **Kali Linux**  
  Penetration testing and ethical hacking distro. Equipped with tools for vulnerability scanning, exploitation, and digital forensics.

## Virtual Machines (VMs)

For virtualization, either **VirtualBox** or **VMware Workstation Pro** can be used as the hypervisor.

Below are the specifications for each virtual machine. These are important for setup:

| VM Name             | Operating System        | Specs           | Storage (Minimum) |
|---------------------|------------------------|-----------------|-------------------|
| `skynet-dc`      | Windows Server 2025    | 2 CPU / 4096 MB | 50 GB             |
| `skynet-win-client` | Windows 11 Enterprise | 2 CPU / 4096 MB | 80 GB             |
| `skynet-linux-client` | Ubuntu 24.04 Desktop  | 1 CPU / 2048 MB | 80 GB             |
| `skynet-sec-work` | Security Onion          | 1 CPU / 2048 MB | 55 GB             |
| `skynet-sec-box`  | Ubuntu 24.04 Desktop    | 2 CPU / 4096 MB | 80 GB             |
| `skynet-corp-svr` | Ubuntu Server 24.04     | 1 CPU / 2048 MB | 25 GB             |
| `skynet-attacker` | Kali Linux 2024       | 1 CPU / 2048 MB | 55 GB             |


## üõ†Ô∏è Tools Used
  **üõ°Ô∏è Enterprise Tools & Defense**
- **Microsoft Active Directory**  
  Centralized directory service for managing users, devices, and permissions in a Windows-based network environment.
- **Wazuh**  
  Open-source security platform offering intrusion detection, log monitoring, vulnerability detection, and compliance reporting.
- **MailHog**  
  Lightweight email testing tool that captures outgoing messages via a fake SMTP server. Emails are viewable through a web UI or API, without sending to real inboxes.

**‚öîÔ∏è Offensive Security Tools**
- **Evil-WinRM**  
  Ruby-based WinRM client used for post-exploitation on Windows systems. Supports remote command execution and data extraction.
- **Hydra**  
  Fast, flexible tool for brute-force and dictionary attacks across various network services like SSH, HTTP, and FTP.
- **SecLists**  
  Curated collection of wordlists and payloads used during reconnaissance, brute-forcing, and exploitation stages.
- **NetExec**  
  Network exploitation tool that enables remote command execution via multiple protocols, aiding lateral movement and privilege escalation.
- **XFreeRDP**  
  Open-source RDP client used to remotely access and control Windows machines for recon and post-exploitation activities.


## Project Phases

### Phase 1: Home Lab Setup & Configuration
- **Virtual Machine Setup**: Installed VirtualBox; created Windows and Linux VMs
- **Security Tools Installation**: Installed Splunk Enterprise on Linux VM; installed Sysmon and Winlogbeat on Windows VM
- **Log Forwarding Configuration**: Configured Sysmon for detailed Windows event logging and Winlogbeat to forward logs to Splunk via HTTP Event Collector
- **(Optional) Network IDS Setup**: Installed and configured Suricata on Linux VM for network traffic monitoring and alerting

### Phase 2: SIEM Alerts & Dashboards
- **Event Data Ingestion**: Successfully ingested Windows Sysmon logs and Suricata alerts into Splunk
- **Alert Rules Configuration**: Created alerts for brute force login attempts, suspicious process creations, and privilege escalation indicators
- **Dashboard Development**: Built interactive Splunk dashboards to visualize endpoint and network security events in real-time

### Phase 3: Incident Response & Analysis
- **Simulated Attack Scenarios**: Generated test attacks (e.g., brute force, suspicious processes) to validate detection capabilities
- **Incident Documentation**: Developed basic SOC playbooks and incident reports based on lab detections and alert triggers
- **Continuous Improvement**: Tuned alert thresholds and log collection for reducing false positives and improving detection accuracy
