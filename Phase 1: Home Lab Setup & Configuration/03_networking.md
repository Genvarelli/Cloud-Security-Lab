## Creating the VirtualBox NAT Network

As part of setting up my project environment, I created a custom NAT Network in VirtualBox to allow internal communication between virtual machines. Below are the steps I followed:

### Steps Taken

1. Opened **VirtualBox**.
2. Navigated to the **Tools** section.
3. Clicked the **Network** icon in the top-right corner.
4. In the **Network Manager**, selected the **NAT Networks** tab.
5. Clicked **Create** to add a new NAT network.
6. Renamed the new network to `skynet-network`.
7. Set the **IPv4 Prefix** to `10.0.0.0/24`.
8. Enabled the **DHCP** option.
9. Clicked **Apply** to save the configuration.

### Outcome

This created a NAT network named `skynet-network` with the subnet `10.0.0.0/24`. DHCP is enabled, allowing virtual machines connected to this network to automatically receive IP addresses.
