### ðŸ“¸ Snapshots During Setup

As I configure the virtual machines for this project, I will take **VirtualBox snapshots** at key points. This ensures I can save the current state of each VM before making significant changes.

Taking snapshots allows me to:
- Safely experiment with configurations
- Easily revert if something breaks
- Avoid starting from scratch after mistakes

This helps keep the setup process smooth and recoverable.
