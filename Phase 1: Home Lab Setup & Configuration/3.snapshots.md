## 📸 Snapshots During Setup

As part of configuring the virtual machines for this project, I will take **VirtualBox snapshots** at key stages. This helps me save the current state of each VM before making significant changes, ensuring I can revert to a stable configuration if needed.

### Benefits of Taking Snapshots:
- 🛠️ **Experiment Safely**: Allows me to experiment with configurations without worrying about breaking the system.
- 🔄 **Easy Reverts**: If something goes wrong, I can easily revert to a previously saved state.
- ⏳ **Avoid Starting Over**: No need to start from scratch if mistakes happen snapshots help restore functionality quickly.

Using snapshots makes the setup process more efficient, recoverable, and flexible, allowing for smooth and controlled changes throughout the project.
