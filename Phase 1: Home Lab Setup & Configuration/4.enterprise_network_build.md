# Skynet Network Setup (Corp environment)

- Skynet is fake business environment that builds software for consumers.
- Skynet is a Windows-native.
- Future Developments:
   - Are looking to build an on-premise/cloud hybrid infrastructure.
   - Grow their Security Operations Center & Threat Detection and Response capabilties.
   - Build dedicated Security Analysis Lab.
   - simulate various cyber-attacks.

## Build Directory services server (Windows 2025)

### Step 1: Setting Up AD in VirtualBox

1. **Open VirtualBox** and click on **"New"** to create a new VM.
2. Name your VM exactly as listed in the table (e.g., `skynet-dc`).
3. Choose a **Folder** on your computer to save the VM files.
4. VirtualBox will usually guess the **OS Type** for you. If it doesn’t, manually select (e.g., "Windows 2025 (64-bit)").
5. For the ISO Image, click the arrow and select the OS you downloaded (e.g, Windows Server 2025.iso)

6. Set the **Base Memory & Processors** according to the specs in the table (e.g., `skynet-dc` gets 4096 MB of RAM and 2 CPUs).

7. For the **Hard Disk**, select "Create a virtual hard disk now," then make sure to **uncheck "Pre-allocate Full Size"** for dynamic allocation. Set the disk size based on the **Storage (Minimum)** in the table (e.g., 50 GB for `skynet-dc`).

8. **Network Setup**: 
   - Once your VM is created, but **before starting it**, go to **Settings > Network**.
   - Set **Adapter 1** to **"NAT"** so the VM can access the internet.
   - If you need the VMs to communicate with each other, add extra network adapters set to **"Internal Network"** and give them a consistent name (e.g., `skynet-network`).

9. Click **"Finish"** to complete the setup.
10. To **install the OS**, select the VM, click **"Start"**, and follow the on-screen instructions using the mounted ISO.

## Active Directory installation
### Step 2: Installing Windows Server (Active Directory Control Server)

To set up the Active Directory Control Server, I followed these steps:

1. **Started the VM** I created for the Active Directory Control Server in VirtualBox.
2. Once the server booted up, I clicked **Next** and **Next** again to begin the installation process.
3. I selected **Windows Server** as the operating system to install, then clicked **Next** to proceed.

5. I **agreed to the Microsoft Licensing Terms** by clicking **Accept**.
6. I chose the **Desktop Experience** option, which ensures the installation of a graphical user interface (GUI) for easier management, then clicked **Next**.

7. For the disk partition, I selected **Partition 2** (the one with the largest size), then clicked **Next** and **Install** to begin the OS installation.

8. The installation took a while, and the server restarted a few times during the process.

After this step, Windows Server is successfully installed with a GUI, and I'm ready to proceed with setting up Active Directory and other roles.

### Step 3: Setting Up the Administrator Account

During the installation of Windows Server, I was prompted to configure the **Administrator account**. Here’s what I did:

1. I set up a **username** for the Administrator account. In my project overview, I’ve listed the default passwords for all the accounts I’ll be using throughout the project.
2. For the **password**, you can choose whatever you prefer for the Administrator account. I used the password listed in my project overview for consistency.
3. Make sure the password meets the required security criteria, which usually includes a mix of upper and lower case letters, numbers, and special characters.
4. After setting the username and password, I clicked **Next** to continue the installation.

Note: You can pick any username and password, but I recommend sticking to the ones mentioned in the project overview to avoid confusion later on.

### Step 4: Finalizing Settings for the Windows Server VM

Once the Windows Server VM is running, I followed these steps to set up a few important configurations:

1. **Log in to the VM**: 
   - In the VM tab, at the top of the window, I clicked the **input bar** and selected **Keyboard > Ctrl+Alt+Del** to prevent getting locked out of the system.
   - Then, I entered the **password** I set earlier.

2. **Confirm Server Manager Panel**: 
   - After logging in, the **Server Manager** panel popped up, which is a good sign! It means we’re ready to start configuring the domain controller.

3. **Adjust Default Settings**: 
   - By default, Windows Server has a **5-minute screen timeout**, which can be annoying, especially when you’re switching between different VMs as you apply configurations. So, I had to change this setting:
     - I went to **Settings > Power & Battery > Screen Timeout**, then set it to **Never** and clicked **Save**.
   
4. **Disable Ctrl+Alt+Del Requirement**: 
   - We won’t need the **Ctrl+Alt+Del** prompt anymore since we won’t be logging out. It’s only needed when rebooting the VM, but we’ll manually trigger it from the input bar.
     - I opened **Windows Search**, typed **"Local Computer"**, and selected **"Edit Group Policy"** to open the **Local Group Policy Editor**.
       ![local computer](img/ad6.png)
     - Then, I navigated down the tree to **Computer Configuration > Windows Settings > Security Settings > Local Policies > Security Options**.
     - In the list, I scrolled down to **"Interactive login: Do not require Ctrl+Alt+Del"**, double-clicked on it, set it to **Enabled**, clicked **Apply**, then **OK** and exited out.
       ![Interactive login: Do not require Ctrl+Alt+Del](img/ad7.png)

Now, the system is ready for domain controller setup without those interruptions.
