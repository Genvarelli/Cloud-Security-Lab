# üõ†Ô∏è Host Machine Setup: Native Linux with VirtualBox

## Why I Switched from Windows

I removed Windows from my machine because it felt bulky and inefficient for my cybersecurity homelab. Running a native Linux system (Ubuntu) provided better performance, more control over system resources, and seamless access to open-source security tools.

Using Linux as my primary OS also aligned with my goal of building real-world skills in a typical enterprise environment ‚Äî where Linux is widely used for servers, security tooling, and infrastructure automation.
