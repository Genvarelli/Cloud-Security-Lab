## 🌐 Creating the VirtualBox NAT Network

As part of setting up my project environment, I created a custom **NAT Network** in VirtualBox to enable internal communication between the virtual machines. Below are the steps I followed:

### Steps Taken:

1. **Open VirtualBox**.
2. Navigate to the **Tools** section.
3. Click on the **Network** icon in the top-right corner.
4. In the **Network Manager**, select the **NAT Networks** tab.
5. Click **Create** to add a new NAT network.
6. Rename the new network to `skynet-network`.
7. Set the **IPv4 Prefix** to `10.0.0.0/24`.
8. Enable the **DHCP** option to allow automatic IP assignment.
9. Click **Apply** to save the configuration.

### Outcome:

This process created a NAT network named `skynet-network` with the subnet `10.0.0.0/24`. DHCP is enabled, meaning any virtual machines connected to this network will automatically receive an IP address.

## 🔗 Connecting Virtual Machines to the NAT Network

Once the `skynet-network` NAT Network was created, I configured each virtual machine to connect to it. This ensures that all VMs on the project are able to communicate over the same internal network.

### Steps Taken for Each VM:

1. **Open VirtualBox**.
2. Select a virtual machine and click on **Settings**.
3. Go to the **Network** tab.
4. Under **Adapter 1**, ensure the checkbox for **Enable Network Adapter** is checked.
5. In the **Attached to:** dropdown, select **NAT Network**.
6. In the **Name** dropdown, select `skynet-network`.
7. Click **OK** (or **Apply**) to save the changes.

### Outcome:

Each VM is now connected to the `skynet-network` NAT Network. This allows them to communicate with each other using internal IP addresses, which are managed by the VirtualBox DHCP server.

This setup ensures that all virtual machines in the project are able to interact seamlessly within the same internal network.
