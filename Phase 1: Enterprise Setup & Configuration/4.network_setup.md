# Skynet Network Setup (Corp Environment)

## Building the Directory Services Server (Windows Server 2025)

### Step 1: Setting Up Active Directory in VirtualBox

To start, I needed to set up a virtual machine (VM) in **VirtualBox**. Here’s how I did it:

1. First, I opened **VirtualBox** and clicked **"New"** to create a new VM.
2. I named the VM exactly as specified (e.g., `skynet-dc`), so it matched the project requirements.
3. Next, I selected a folder to store the VM files.
4. VirtualBox automatically detected the **OS Type**. If it hadn’t, I would have manually chosen **Windows Server 2025 (64-bit)**.
5. I then selected the **ISO Image** for the operating system I’d downloaded (e.g., `Windows Server 2025.iso`).

6. For the **Base Memory & Processors**, I followed the specifications given in the project table. For example, the `skynet-dc` VM needed 4096 MB of RAM and 2 CPUs.

7. When configuring the **Hard Disk**, I chose "Create a virtual hard disk now" and ensured that the **"Pre-allocate Full Size"** option was unchecked (this allows for dynamic allocation). For disk size, I used the minimum storage requirements, which was 50 GB for `skynet-dc`.

8. For **Network Setup**, before starting the VM, I went to **Settings > Network** and:
   - Set **Adapter 1** to **"NAT"** for internet access.
   - Added extra adapters to allow VM-to-VM communication by choosing **"Internal Network"** and naming it `skynet-network` (to keep it consistent).

9. After all that, I clicked **Finish** to complete the VM setup.
10. To install the operating system, I selected the VM and clicked **"Start"**. Then I followed the on-screen instructions, using the mounted ISO to install Windows Server.

### Step 2: Installing Windows Server (Active Directory Control Server)

Once the VM was created, I started the installation process:

1. I started the VM and clicked **Next** to begin the installation.
2. I accepted the **Microsoft Licensing Terms** and clicked **Next** to proceed.
3. I chose the **Desktop Experience** option, which installs the graphical user interface (GUI) for easier management.

4. I selected **Partition 2**, the largest partition, and clicked **Next** > **Install** to begin the installation.

5. The server rebooted several times during the installation process, and once complete, Windows Server was ready with the GUI installed.

### Step 3: Setting Up the Administrator Account

During installation, I was prompted to set up the **Administrator account**. Here’s what I did:

1. I created the **Administrator** username (using the default credentials as noted in the project overview).
2. I entered a secure **password** (mix of letters, numbers, and special characters as required).
3. I clicked **Next** to finish the setup.

**Note**: For consistency, I used the default credentials listed in the project overview.

### Step 4: Finalising Settings for the Windows Server VM

Once the server VM was up and running, I made a few adjustments to optimise the setup:

1. I **logged in to the VM**:
   - In the VM tab, I clicked the **input bar** and selected **Keyboard > Ctrl+Alt+Del** to ensure I wasn’t locked out.
   - Then, I entered the password I had set earlier.

2. The **Server Manager** panel appeared, confirming that the system was ready for domain controller configuration.

3. To **adjust the screen timeout** (since the default 5-minute timeout was annoying), I:
   - Went to **Settings > Power & Battery > Screen Timeout** and set it to **Never**.

4. I disabled the **Ctrl+Alt+Del** requirement for login, which would be useful since I wasn’t planning to log out frequently:
   - I opened **Local Group Policy Editor** by typing **gpedit.msc** in Windows Search.
   - I navigated to **Computer Configuration > Windows Settings > Security Settings > Local Policies > Security Options**.
   - There, I double-clicked on **"Interactive login: Do not require Ctrl+Alt+Del"**, set it to **Enabled**, clicked **Apply**, and then **OK**.

   ![Interactive Login](img/ad8.png)

5. To enhance the VM experience with **full screen, shared clipboard, and drag-and-drop**, I enabled **integration features**:
   - In the **VirtualBox menu bar**, I went to **Devices → Insert Guest Additions CD Image**.
   - I ran the installer inside the VM and rebooted.
   - After the reboot, I enabled the **Bidirectional Shared Clipboard** and **Drag and Drop** through **Machine → Settings → General → Advanced**.

## Directory Services Server Configuration

### Step 1: Apply Static IP Address

To ensure the server’s IP address doesn’t change, I configured a **static IP**:

1. I opened **Control Panel** and navigated to **Network and Sharing Centre** > **Change adapter settings**.
2. I right-clicked on the **Ethernet** adapter and selected **Properties**.
3. I selected **Internet Protocol Version 4 (TCP/IPv4)** and clicked **Properties**.
   - I entered:
     - **IP Address**: `10.0.0.5`
     - **Subnet Mask**: `255.255.255.0`
     - **Default Gateway**: `10.0.0.1`

   ![Network Connections](img/networkconnections1.png)

5. This IP setup fits within the **/24 subnet** range, providing up to 254 usable IPs from `10.0.0.1` to `10.0.0.254`.

### Step 2: Install Roles and Features

To configure the server as a domain controller, I added the required roles and features:

1. I opened **Server Manager**.
2. I clicked **Add Roles and Features** to begin the installation process.
3. I followed the default wizard configuration and clicked **Next**.

   ![Default Wizard](img/defaultwizardconfig.png)

4. I selected **Role-based or feature-based installation** and clicked **Next**.
5. In the **Select destination server** section, I chose the server at `10.0.0.5` and clicked **Next**.
6. I selected the **Active Directory Domain Services (AD DS)** role and clicked **Add Features** when prompted.

7. I also selected the **DHCP Server** role and clicked **Add Features**.

8. Then, I selected the **DNS Server** role and added it in the same way.

   ![DNS Server](img/dnsserver.png)

9. After going through all the screens, I clicked **Install** to complete the process.

Once complete, the server was fully set up with **AD DS**, **DHCP**, and **DNS** roles.

### Step 3: Promoting the Server to a Domain Controller

Here's how I promoted the server to a domain controller:

1. Opened **Server Manager**, went to **AD DS**, and clicked **"More..."** on the amber notification at the top.

   ![Server Manager](img/servermanager.png)
   ![Server Manager](img/servermanager_adds.png)
3. Clicked **"Promote this server to a domain controller"**.

   ![Promote Adds](img/promoteadds.png)
5. Selected **"Add a new forest"** and entered `corp.skynet-dc.com` as the domain name.  
   This will act as the main domain for connecting all workstations.
   ![Add new forest](img/addnewforest.png)
6. Clicked **Next**. On the **Domain Controller Options** screen, I left the defaults selected.  
   For the **DSRM (Directory Services Restore Mode)** password, I used the same one set earlier for the administrator account.
   ![Domain Password](img/domainpassword.png)
7. Clicked **Next** twice.

8. Left **CORP** as the **NetBIOS** name and clicked **Next**.

9. Continued clicking **Next** until I reached the **Prerequisites Check**.  
   Allowed it to apply settings automatically, then clicked **Install**.

10. Once the installation completed, the window closed and the server restarted automatically.


Now, the **Windows Server VM** was fully configured as a domain controller with all necessary services installed and ready for use.
