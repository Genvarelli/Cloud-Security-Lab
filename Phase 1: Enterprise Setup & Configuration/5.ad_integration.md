## Active Directory Integration

With the domain controller successfully configured with **Active Directory**, **DHCP**, and **DNS**, I connected various **Linux** and **Windows** workstations to the domain.

### Windows 11 Enterprise Setup

Set up **Windows 11 Enterprise** to simulate a real workplace environment. In growing businesses, employees are given desktops or laptops—called **workstations** in different office locations. These workstations often run **Windows 11 Enterprise** or **Pro**, which can be managed using **Active Directory**.

#### Windiws 11 installation

1. **Open VirtualBox** and click on **"New"** to create a new VM.
2. Name your VM exactly as listed in the table (e.g., `skynet-win-client`).
3. Choose a **Folder** on your computer to save the VM files.
4. For the **ISO Image**, click the arrow and select the OS you downloaded.
5. VirtualBox will usually guess the **OS Type** for you. If it doesn’t, manually select the correct one (e.g., "Windows 11 (64-bit)").
6. Set the **Base Memory & Processors** according to the specs in the table (e.g., `skynet-dc` gets 4096 MB of RAM and 2 CPUs).
7. For the **Hard Disk**, select "Create a virtual hard disk now," then make sure to **uncheck "Pre-allocate Full Size"** for dynamic allocation. Set the disk size based on the **Storage (Minimum)** in the table (e.g., 80 GB for `skynet-win-client`).
8. **Network Setup**: 
   - Once your VM is created, but **before starting it**, go to **Settings > Network**.
   - Set **Adapter 1** to **"NAT"** so the VM can access the internet.
   - If you need the VMs to communicate with each other, add extra network adapters set to **"Internal Network"** and give them a consistent name (e.g., `skynet-network`).
9. Click **"Finish"** to complete the setup.
10. To **install the OS**, select the VM, click **"Start"**, and follow the on-screen instructions using the mounted ISO.
