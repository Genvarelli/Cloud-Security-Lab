## Active Directory Integration

With the domain controller successfully configured with **Active Directory**, **DHCP**, and **DNS**, I connected various **Linux** and **Windows** workstations to the domain.

### Windows 11 Enterprise Setup

Set up **Windows 11 Enterprise** to simulate a real workplace environment. In growing businesses, employees are given desktops or laptops called **workstations** in different office locations. These workstations often run **Windows 11 Enterprise** or **Pro**, which can be managed using **Active Directory**.

#### Windows 11 installation
Follow the ISO download steps in `vbox_setup.md` in this repo to Configure system resources, Set up storage, Configure networking and then Start the VM.
