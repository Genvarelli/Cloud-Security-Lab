## 🏢 Active Directory Integration

After configuring the **Domain Controller** with **Active Directory**, **DHCP**, and **DNS**, I joined multiple **Linux** and **Windows** workstations to the domain.

## 🪟 Windows 11 Enterprise Setup

Windows 11 Enterprise simulates a realistic workplace setup. In enterprise environments, employees are assigned **Windows workstations** (typically running Enterprise or Pro editions) managed via **Active Directory**.

### ⚙️ Installation Process

1. Follow the ISO setup steps in [`general_installation.md`](./1.general_installation.md):
   - Start the VM

2. When the installer reaches the **"Where do you want to install Windows?"** screen:
   - Click **New** to create a partition
   - Click **Apply**
   - Select the **always choose the largest partition**
   - Click **Next** to begin installation

### 🚫 Bypass Microsoft Account (Offline Setup)

To prevent online account sign-in and simulate an offline lab environment:

3. In **VirtualBox**, with the VM (`skynet-win-client`):
   - Go to **Machine > Settings > Network**
   - Set **Adapter 1** to `Host-only Adapter`
   - Click **OK**

   → This disables internet access to bypass the Microsoft account requirement.

4. On the **Microsoft account sign-in screen**, press:
   - **Fn + Shift + F10** to launch the **Command Prompt**  
   - If this doesn’t work, try **Right Ctrl + F10** or use VirtualBox:  
     **Input > Keyboard > Insert Ctrl+Shift+F10**

   ![Command Prompt](img/commandprompt.png)

5. In the command prompt, run:
   ```bash
   oobe\bypassnro

- Press **Enter**

- The VM will reboot and return to the setup process

### 📡 Wi-Fi Setup

- On the **Wi-Fi screen**, select:  
  **“I don’t have internet”**

---

### 👤 Create Local Account

- Enter a username:  `skynet-sec-work`  
  _(This is temporary; it will be joined to the domain later)_

- Set a password and complete the security questions → Use the credentials listed in your[Project Overview](./README.md)

***🌐 Restore Network Access see*** [`general_installation.md`](general_installation.md).


✅ **Result**: Windows 11 is installed, Microsoft login is bypassed, and the VM is ready for domain integration.

next is to connect the windows 11 vm to the active direntory machine. 

install guest editions for windows 11 vm.

i set up a static ip address for this windows 11.
go to control panel, got to network & internet, network & sharing centre, change adapter settings, right click the ethernet and select properties, select internet proocol v4, click properties.

refer to the project overview guide for the ip addresses, in this window i chose 'use the following ip address and set the ip address to 10.0.0.100, subnet: 255.255.255.0, default gateway: 10.0.0.1

i added in my preferred dns server as 10.0.0.5. i clicked okay, then close
basically i'm configuring my hardcoding dns server ip address in this case its my domain controller. so when my windows machine need to go how and look for a host name, it will first run through the domain controoler on behalf of this machine. it will query   or resolve that domain. this is for lab environment and not something i would see in a production environment.

I went back into my control panel and serched change workgroup name, dialoge box pop up and click chnage (refer to overview for names). I renamed it skynet-win-client, now click member of domain and i type in 'corp.skynet-dc.com' and ok and ok again
