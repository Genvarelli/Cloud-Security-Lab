### 🚫 Bypass Microsoft Account (Offline Setup)

To prevent online account sign-in and simulate an offline lab environment:

3. In **VirtualBox**, with the VM (`skynet-win-client`) powered off:
   - Go to **Machine > Settings > Network**
   - Set **Adapter 1** to `Host-only Adapter`
   - Click **OK**

   → This disables internet access to bypass the Microsoft account requirement.

4. On the **Microsoft account sign-in screen**, press:
   - **Fn + Shift + F10** to launch the **Command Prompt**  
   - If this doesn’t work, try **Right Ctrl + F10** or use VirtualBox:  
     **Input > Keyboard > Insert Ctrl+Shift+F10**

   ![Command Prompt](img/commandprompt.png)

5. In the command prompt, run:
   ```bash
   oobe\bypassnro

- Press **Enter**

- The VM will reboot and return to the setup process

### 📡 Wi-Fi Setup

- On the **Wi-Fi screen**, select:  
  **“I don’t have internet”**

### 👤 Create Local Account

- Enter a username:  
  `skynet-sec-work`  
  _(This is temporary; it will be joined to the domain later)_

- Set a password and complete the security questions  
  → Use the credentials listed in your **Project Overview**

---

### 🌐 Restore Network Access

After Windows boots to the desktop:

1. Go to **Machine > Settings > Network**
2. Change **Adapter 1** back to: `NAT Network`
3. Select your custom network: `skynet-network`
4. Click **OK**

---

✅ **Result**: Windows 11 is installed, Microsoft login is bypassed, and the VM is ready for domain integration.
