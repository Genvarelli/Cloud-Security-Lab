# 🏢 Corporate Server (`skynet-corp-svr`) Overview

## 🧭 Purpose

In enterprise environments, **dedicated servers** are used for backend services that support user and application operations. These servers may be deployed **on-premises** or in the **cloud**, depending on business scale and infrastructure.

Examples of common dedicated servers in business environments:

- **Licensing Server** – Issues and manages software licenses for workstations.
- **Internal File Server** – Shares files internally (e.g., via SharePoint or cloud alternatives like Microsoft 365).
- **Database Server** – Stores and retrieves structured information.
- **VPN Server** – Enables secure remote access to the internal network.
- **Jumpbox (Bastion Host)** – Acts as a secure entry point into isolated or protected environments.

## 🎯 Our Goal

We'll provision a dedicated server named `skynet-corp-svr`.

This server will function as a **Jumpbox**, acting as the **central gateway** to access internal services such as:
- **FTP**
- **DNS**
- **Email**

Without access to this Jumpbox, these services will be **unreachable**. This setup is **intentional**, designed to reduce the attack surface and enforce strict access control.

> 📌 Note: These internal services will run in **containers**, not separate VMs, to conserve resources.

## 📦 Why Containers?

Containers are lightweight, isolated environments that package applications with their dependencies. They run from Docker images and share the host OS kernel (Ubuntu 22.04 in our case).

### Key Concepts

- **Docker** – A platform for developing, shipping, and running applications in containers.
- **Docker Engine** – The background service that powers containerization.

Think of a **Docker Image** as a blueprint defining what software and dependencies a container should run.

## 🧰 How We’ll Set It Up

We'll use an existing VM (`skynet-linux-client`) as the base:

### Clone VM

1. Clone the `skynet-linux-client` VM.
2. Rename the clone to: `skynet-corp-svr`.

This saves time and maintains consistency across our infrastructure.

## 🛡️ Security Implications

Running a dedicated server, especially a **Jumpbox**, introduces certain risks:

### Potential Risks

- **Single Point of Failure**  
  If compromised, the Jumpbox provides access to the entire internal network.

- **Lateral Movement**  
  Weak segmentation or insufficient endpoint protections can allow attackers to pivot into other systems.

- **Lack of Monitoring**  
  Without logging or auditing, malicious actions (e.g., file transfers or commands) may go unnoticed.

> 💡 Best Practice: Jumpboxes should be closely monitored and isolated, with hardened access controls and logging enabled.
