
## ⬇️ Downloading and Setting Up VMs in VirtualBox

Here's how I downloaded the OS ISOs and set up the virtual machines in VirtualBox, following my defined specifications.

---

### Downloaded Operating System ISOs

I made sure to get the official installation ISO files for each operating system:

* **Windows Server 2025**: I found and downloaded the evaluation ISO.
* **Windows 11 Enterprise**: I downloaded this through my Microsoft account.
* **Ubuntu 24.04 Desktop**: I downloaded it from the [Ubuntu Official Site](https://ubuntu.com/download/desktop).
* **Ubuntu Server 24.04**: I also got this from the [Ubuntu Official Site](https://ubuntu.com/download/server).
* **Security Onion**: I downloaded the ISO from the [Security Onion Official Site](https://securityonionsolutions.com/download/).
* **Kali Linux 2024**: I chose the "Installer Images" option from the [Kali Linux Official Site](https://www.kali.org/get-kali/#kali-virtual-machines) for a clean install.

### Creating the VM in VirtualBox

1. Opened **VirtualBox** and clicked **New** to create a VM named `skynet-dc`.
2. Selected a folder to store VM files.
3. Chose **Windows Server 2025 (64-bit)** as the OS type.
4. Selected the `Windows Server 2025.iso` as the installation ISO.

6. Created a **dynamically allocated** virtual hard disk (unchecked “Pre-allocate”) with **50 GB** space.

7. Configured **network adapters**:
   - Adapter 1: **NAT** (for internet access)
   - Adapter 2: **Internal Network**, named `skynet-network`

# 📦 Enabling Full Integration Features

To enable smooth VM usability by turning on:

- ✅ Full screen support  
- ✅ Shared clipboard (Host ↔ Guest)  
- ✅ Drag & drop (Host ↔ Guest)

Guest Additions were installed and configured for:

- Windows 11  
- Ubuntu Linux  
- Kali Linux  

---

## 🧰 General Process (All VMs)

1. Start the VM.
2. In the **VirtualBox menu bar**, go to:  

> 📸 **Devices → Insert Guest Additions CD image...** ![Insert Guest Additions CD image](img/insertcdimage.png)
3. Run the installer **inside the VM** when prompted.
4. Reboot the VM.
5. Enable integration features via:

> 📸 **Machine → Settings → General → Advanced → Shared Clipboard → Bidirectional
Devices → Drag and Drop → Bidirectional** ![Integration](img/integration.png)

## 🪟 Windows 11 VM

- Open the Guest Additions CD from **File Explorer**.
- Run `VBoxWindowsAdditions.exe` as Administrator.
- Follow the installer steps and reboot when finished.

---

## 🐧 Ubuntu & Kali Linux VMs

- After inserting the CD, open the file manager and run:  
 `VBoxLinuxAdditions.run`

> 📸 **(Right-click → Open in Terminal → Run with sudo if needed)** ![Open in Terminal](img/openterminal.png)

> 📸 ![Terminal](img/terminal.png)

     ```bash
     sudo ./VBoxLinuxAdditions.run

- You may need to install required packages beforehand:
     ```bash
     sudo apt update
     sudo apt install -y build-essential dkms linux-headers-$(uname -r)

- Reboot the VM after installation.

✅ Result

Once Guest Additions are installed and integration options are enabled:

- VMs can enter full-screen mode seamlessly.
- Clipboard and drag-and-drop work both ways between host and guest.
