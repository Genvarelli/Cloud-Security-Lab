# ðŸ§° Installing VirtualBox on Ubuntu (From Official Site)

I installed **VirtualBox version 7.0.26r168464** by downloading the `.deb` package directly from the official Oracle VirtualBox website.

### Installation Steps:

1. **Go to the official download page**  
   ðŸ‘‰ [https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Linux_Downloads](https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Linux_Downloads)

2. **Download the Debian package** for your Ubuntu version (e.g., `Ubuntu 20.04`, `22.04`, etc.)

3. **Install the package using your terminal**
   ```bash
   cd ~/Downloads
   sudo dpkg -i virtualbox-7.0_*.deb

4. **Fix any missing dependencies (if needed)**
   ```bash
   sudo apt --fix-broken install

5. **Verify the installation**
   ```bash
   virtualbox --help

VirtualBox is now ready for use. I use it to run virtual machines as part of my cybersecurity homelab setup.
   ```
   âœ… Version installed: VirtualBox 7.0.26r168464 on Ubuntu Linux

## Host Key in VirtualBox

The **Host Key** is a special key (typically the **Right CTRL**) that lets you interact with VirtualBox instead of the guest operating system inside the virtual machine (VM). It's used to exit the VM and return to the host system.

### Default Host Key:

- The default is usually the **Right CTRL** key, but it may vary based on your system or preferences.

**Purpose:**

The Host Key allows you to:

**1. Release Input:** If the VM has captured your keyboard or mouse, pressing the Host Key returns control to the host system.

**2. Access VirtualBox Features:** Use key combinations to perform actions like switching to full-screen, capturing screenshots, or opening the VirtualBox menu.

To check your current Host Key, go to **File âž” Preferences** in VirtualBox.

Go to **Input âž” Host Key Combination** to view or change the Host Key. To set a new key, select the box and press the desired key on your keyboard.
