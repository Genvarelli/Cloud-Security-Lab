# 🧰 Installing VirtualBox on Ubuntu (From Official Site)

I installed **VirtualBox version 7.0.26r168464** by downloading the `.deb` package directly from the official Oracle VirtualBox website.

### Installation Steps:

1. **Go to the official download page**  
   👉 [https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Linux_Downloads](https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Linux_Downloads)

2. **Download the Debian package** for your Ubuntu version (e.g., `Ubuntu 20.04`, `22.04`, etc.)

3. **Install the package using your terminal**
   ```bash
   cd ~/Downloads
   sudo dpkg -i virtualbox-7.0_*.deb

4. **Fix any missing dependencies (if needed)**
   ```bash
   sudo apt --fix-broken install

5. **Verify the installation**
   ```bash
   virtualbox --help

VirtualBox is now ready for use. I use it to run virtual machines as part of my cybersecurity homelab setup.
   ```
   ✅ Version installed: VirtualBox 7.0.26r168464 on Ubuntu Linux

## ⬇️ Downloading and Setting Up VMs in VirtualBox

Here's how I downloaded the OS ISOs and set up the virtual machines in VirtualBox, following my defined specifications.

---

### Downloaded Operating System ISOs

I made sure to get the official installation ISO files for each operating system:

* **Windows Server 2025**: I found and downloaded the evaluation ISO.
* **Windows 11 Enterprise**: I downloaded this through my Microsoft account.
* **Ubuntu 24.04 Desktop**: I downloaded it from the [Ubuntu Official Site](https://ubuntu.com/download/desktop).
* **Ubuntu Server 24.04**: I also got this from the [Ubuntu Official Site](https://ubuntu.com/download/server).
* **Security Onion**: I downloaded the ISO from the [Security Onion Official Site](https://securityonionsolutions.com/download/).
* **Kali Linux 2024**: I chose the "Installer Images" option from the [Kali Linux Official Site](https://www.kali.org/get-kali/#kali-virtual-machines) for a clean install.

### Create the Virtual Machine

1. **Open VirtualBox** and click **"New"**.
2. **Name the VM** exactly as listed in your table (e.g., `skynet-win-client`).
3. **Choose a folder** where you want to store the VM files.
4. Under **ISO Image**, click the dropdown arrow and select the **Windows 11 Enterprise ISO** you downloaded.
5. VirtualBox will try to detect the OS. If it doesn’t, manually select:
   - **Type**: Microsoft Windows  
   - **Version**: Windows 11 (64-bit)

### Configure System Resources

6. Set **Memory (RAM)** and **Processors (CPUs)** as specified in your project table.  
   _Example: `skynet-win-client` → 4096 MB RAM, 2 CPUs_

### Configure Storage

7. For **Hard Disk**, choose:
   - **Option**: “Create a virtual hard disk now”
   - **Uncheck**: “Pre-allocate Full Size” _(this enables dynamic disk sizing)_
   - **Set Disk Size** based on your table  
     _Example: 80 GB for `skynet-win-client`_

### Set Up Networking

8. Before starting the VM:
   - Go to **Settings > Network**
   - **Adapter 1**: Set to **NAT** (for internet access)
   - To allow VM-to-VM communication:
     - Add a second adapter (**Adapter 2**)
     - Set it to **Internal Network**
     - Name it consistently across VMs (e.g., `skynet-network`)

### 🏁 5. Finalize & Start

9. Click **Finish** to complete VM creation.
10. Select the VM and click **Start**.
11. Follow the on-screen instructions to install Windows 11 using the mounted ISO.

# 📦 Enabling Full Integration Features

To enable smooth VM usability by turning on:

- ✅ Full screen support  
- ✅ Shared clipboard (Host ↔ Guest)  
- ✅ Drag & drop (Host ↔ Guest)

Guest Additions were installed and configured for:

- Windows 11  
- Ubuntu Linux  
- Kali Linux  

---

## 🧰 General Process (All VMs)

1. Start the VM.
2. In the **VirtualBox menu bar**, go to:  

> 📸 **Devices → Insert Guest Additions CD image...** ![Insert Guest Additions CD image](img/insertcdimage.png)
3. Run the installer **inside the VM** when prompted.
4. Reboot the VM.
5. Enable integration features via:

> 📸 **Machine → Settings → General → Advanced → Shared Clipboard → Bidirectional
Devices → Drag and Drop → Bidirectional** ![Integration](img/integration.png)

## 🪟 Windows 11 VM

- Open the Guest Additions CD from **File Explorer**.
- Run `VBoxWindowsAdditions.exe` as Administrator.
- Follow the installer steps and reboot when finished.

---

## 🐧 Ubuntu & Kali Linux VMs

- After inserting the CD, open the file manager and run:  
 `VBoxLinuxAdditions.run`

> 📸 **(Right-click → Open in Terminal → Run with sudo if needed)** ![Open in Terminal](img/openterminal.png)

> 📸 ![Terminal](img/terminal.png)

     ```bash
     sudo ./VBoxLinuxAdditions.run

- You may need to install required packages beforehand:
     ```bash
     sudo apt update
     sudo apt install -y build-essential dkms linux-headers-$(uname -r)

- Reboot the VM after installation.

✅ Result

Once Guest Additions are installed and integration options are enabled:

- VMs can enter full-screen mode seamlessly.
- Clipboard and drag-and-drop work both ways between host and guest.
