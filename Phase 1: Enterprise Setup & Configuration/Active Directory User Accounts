# Creating Active Directory User Accounts

Next, I started creating user accounts in Active Directory.

AD user accounts allow individual users to sign in to their assigned workstations. These accounts represent user identities and can also be used to log in to multiple machines across the domain if permitted.

> These accounts are essential for managing access, applying group policies, and assigning roles or permissions across the network.

Now, the **Windows Server VM** was fully configured as a domain controller with all necessary services installed and ready for use.
