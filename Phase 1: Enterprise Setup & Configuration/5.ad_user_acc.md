# Creating Active Directory User Accounts

Next, I started creating user accounts in Active Directory.

AD user accounts allow individual users to sign in to their assigned workstations. These accounts represent user identities and can also be used to log in to multiple machines across the domain if permitted.

> These accounts are essential for managing access, applying group policies, and assigning roles or permissions across the network.

With the domain controller fully configured, I created user accounts that will later be used to log in from client machines.

### Step 1: Open Active Directory Users and Computers

1. In **Server Manager**, clicked the **Tools** dropdown (top-right corner).
2. Selected **Active Directory Users and Computers**.

3. In the left-hand pane, expanded the domain tree.
4. Clicked on the **Users** container to manage accounts.

### Step 2: Create User â€“ John Doe

1. Right-clicked the **Users** folder â†’ selected **New > User**.
ðŸ“¸ ![Users](img/users.png)
2. Filled in the following:
   - **First Name**: John
   - **Last Name**: Doe
   - **User logon name**: `john.doe`

> This user will be linked to the `-win-client` VM.
ðŸ“¸ ![Users](img/user1.png)

3. Adjusted password options:
   - **Deselected**: "User must change password at next logon"
   - **Selected**: "User cannot change password"

> These settings help maintain consistency and prevent sync issues during testing.

4. Entered the predefined password from the project overview.
5. Clicked **Next**, then **Finish** to complete the user creation.

### Step 3: Create User â€“ Jane Doe

1. Repeated the same process to create a second user:
   - **First Name**: Jane
   - **Last Name**: Doe
   - **User logon name**: `jane.doe`
   - Used the same password settings for consistency.

## Creating a VM Snapshot (Baseline)

To preserve this configuration state, I created a snapshot of the domain controller VM in **VirtualBox**:

1. In the **VirtualBox** menu, selected **Machine > Take Snapshot**.
2. Named the snapshot: `base` â€” this marks the **baseline configuration** of the domain controller.

This snapshot acts as a restore point and will help recover progress if any future misconfigurations occur.
