# Windows 10 Enterprise LTSC Setup (Active Directory Integration)

After configuring the **Domain Controller** with **Active Directory**, **DHCP**, and **DNS**, I joined multiple **Linux** and **Windows** workstations to the domain. Windows 10 Enterprise LTSC simulates a realistic workplace setup. In enterprise environments, employees are assigned **Windows workstations** (typically running Enterprise or Pro editions) managed via **Active Directory**.

### 📝 Prerequisites

- **VirtualBox** or **VMware Workstation Pro** is installed.
- A **Windows 11 Enterprise VM** is created with the ISO attached.
- **Windows Server 2025** is set up with **Active Directory Domain Services (AD DS)** enabled and running.

   - Select **Disk 0 Unallocated Space**
   - Click **Create Partition** → Accept default size → **Apply**

5. Wait for installation and automatic reboot.
6. Follow the on-screen steps for region and keyboard setup.

## Bypass Microsoft Account

7. At the Microsoft Account sign-in screen:
   - **Change network**: From `NAT` to `Host-only Adapter` (isolates the VM from the internet).
   - Press **Shift + F10** to open the command line.
   - Type: `oobe\bypassnro` → Press **Enter** → VM restarts.

8. On reboot:
   - Continue region/keyboard setup.
   - On the "Connect to Microsoft Account" screen, choose **I don’t have Internet**.
   - Set a temporary **account name** and **password**.
   - Answer **3 security questions**.
